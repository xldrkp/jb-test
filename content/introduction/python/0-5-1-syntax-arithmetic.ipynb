    "* No **spaces or tab** characters allowed at the start of a statement: Indentation plays a special role in Python (see the section on control statements) and can cause issues when compiling or executing code. For now simply ensure that all statements start at the **beginning of the line**.\n",
    "* The '#' character indicates that the rest of the line is a comment\n",
    "* Statements finish at the end of the line:\n",
    "  * Except when there is an open bracket or parenthesis:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "1+2\n",
    "+3  #illegal continuation of the sum\n",
    "(1+2\n",
    "             + 3) # perfectly OK even with spaces\n",
    "```\n",
    "  * A single backslash at the end of the line can also be used to indicate that a statement is still incomplete  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "1 + \\\n",
    "   2 + 3 # this is also OK\n",
    "```\n",

    "    + You know how, where and when the data have been collected.\n",
    "    + You know what changes have been done on the dataset before you used it.\n",
    "    + You know the meaning of each attribute in the dataset.\n",
    "+ __Data preprocessing__\n",
    "    + You understand the distribution of the attributes in the dataset.\n",
    "    + There are no (obvious) wrong values in the dataset.\n",
    "    + There are no missing values in the dataset.\n",
    "    + Each attribute is formatted under the right type (numerical, category, etc...).\n",
    "+ __Data usage__\n",
    "    + You know the type of problem that you want to solve (regression, classification or other).\n",
    "    + You know which attributes are important for the problem you want to solve.\n",
    "    + The dataset corresponds to the environment the model will be used in (time period, geographical area, representation of different classes, etc...).\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you check all items in this checklist, it is likely that you are starting your data science project on a good basis, congratulations!"
